Project Description: This project aims to build a system that detects fake news or misinformation in news articles or social media posts. Fake news spreads widely and has the potential to have devastating effects on society and country. We should come up with a solution that can overcome the problem. The goal of this project is to use machine learning to create algorithms that can automatically recognize and label fake news stories. The system is engineered to efficiently analyze textual content by utilizing natural language processing techniques and feature extraction strategies. 

Data Description: 
The dataset we are using contains several entries of news articles and it indicates if the article is fake or real by labeling it. Our Dataset is sourced from Kaggle which has 78098 rows and 4 columns merged from four popular datasets (Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political). Out of this, we have 72134 news articles with 35028 real and 37106 fake news. We use ‘Label’ as our target column with values (0 - Fake , 1 - Real). Along with this we also plan to use some database resources available at the Mardigian library. We will be using Tableau as a data mining tool in our project. We intend to build our model with logistic regression as the output of our dataset is a binary value ie: if the data is real or fake (0 or 1).
